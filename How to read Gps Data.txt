when looking at serial output the gps will display a "NEMA Sentence". That is an acronym for the data that follows it. nema stands for the National Marine Electronics Association 
$GPRMC stands for: Global Positioning Recommended Minimum Coordinates.
the data following $GPRMC shows the time, date ,lat & lon, altitude, land speed, and fix type.
fix type shows if the GPS has enough data for a loctation (2d fix) or location and altitude (3d fix)
